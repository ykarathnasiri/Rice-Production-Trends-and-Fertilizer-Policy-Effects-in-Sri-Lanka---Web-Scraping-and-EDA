#### The notebook titled "Rice Production Trends and Fertilizer Policy Effects in Sri Lanka - A Data-Driven Study (Web Scraping and EDA)" focuses on analyzing rice production data in Sri Lanka, particularly investigating the impact of fertilizer policies on rice yields. Below is an outline of the contents based on the extracted notebook cells:

## 1. Introduction
The study aims to explore how fertilizer policies, including a fertilizer ban from 2021â€“2023, have affected rice production in Sri Lanka.
The notebook employs web scraping techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and analyze trends in rice cultivation and yield.
## 2. Data Collection
Web Scraping: Rice production and fertilizer usage data are collected from various online sources.
Libraries Used: Python libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4, and pandas for data extraction and manipulation.
## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.
Visualization: Various plots are generated to observe trends, such as:
Production trends over time.
Correlations between the area under cultivation and rice yields.
Yearly yield comparisons.
## 4. Analysis of Fertilizer Ban Impact
Correlation Analysis: A negative correlation is observed between the cultivated area and rice yield. A specific analysis indicates a correlation of -0.32107, suggesting a moderate inverse relationship.
Effect on Yield: The analysis speculates that the fertilizer ban has led to decreased productivity per hectare despite potentially increasing the cultivated area.
## 5. Conclusion
The notebook summarizes the potential consequences of the fertilizer policy, highlighting its adverse impact on rice productivity.

Rice Production Trends and Fertilizer Policy Effects in Sri Lanka - A Data-Driven Study
## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of fertilizer policies on rice production in Sri Lanka, with a specific focus on the period from 2021 to 2023 when a fertilizer ban was implemented. The study explores trends in rice cultivation, yield, and the potential consequences of policy changes using web-scraped data and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Files and Structure
Notebook: Contains code for web scraping, data cleaning, EDA, and analysis of trends in rice production.
